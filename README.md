This is a project built during internship. 
It's a web scraper in Python with BeautifulSoup. Web scraping is the process of gathering information from the Internet and BeautifulSoup is a Python library for parsing structured data, which is helping us to code quickly and avoiding confusions and bugs. It allows us to interact with HTML in a similar way to how interact with a web page using developer tools.
